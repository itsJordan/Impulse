 * This class formats a time in seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
 * No more pesky huge integers like 5473973 seconds. With this utility,
 * separating into conventional time is easy. All you have to do is call
 * TimeUtil.format(integer) in another class.
 *
 * If you decide to use it, it would be really nice if you could accredit me.
